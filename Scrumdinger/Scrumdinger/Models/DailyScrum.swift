// ForEach structures generate dynamic views by iterating over identifiable data. In the previous section, you used a key path to identify scrums by their titles. This approach worked for prototyping because each scrum in the sample data has a unique title. But users would experience issues if they tried to create a new scrum with the same title as an existing one.
// To work with user-generated content, youâ€™ll make DailyScrum conform to the Identifiable protocol for a more robust way to communicate identity. The protocol has one requirement: an id property that provides a stable identifier for the entity.

/*
 // Before Identifiable
 struct DailyScrum {
     var title: String
     var attendees: [String]
     var lengthInMinutes: Int
     var theme: Theme
 }

 // After Identifiable

    // Add a constant named id of type UUID.

    //Remember - Add an initializer that assigns a default value to the id property.
    // When you define a default value for a parameter, you can omit that parameter when you call an initializer or function.
